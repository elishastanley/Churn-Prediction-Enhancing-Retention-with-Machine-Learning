## Enhancing Customer Retention through Churn Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach to Classification Models

## Introduction

Customer attrition is one of the biggest expenditures of any
organization. Customer churn otherwise known as customer attrition or
customer turnover is the percentage of customers that stopped using your
company\'s product or service within a specified timeframe.\
For instance, if you began the year with 500 customers but later ended
with 480 customers, the percentage of customers that left would be 4%.
If we could figure out why a customer leaves and when they leave with
reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to
strategize their retention initiatives manifold.

## Problem Statement

In this project, we aim to determine the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization, identify key indicators of churn, and develop retention strategies to mitigate this issue.

## Goal and Objectives

- **Goal:** To reduce customer churn by identifying at-risk customers and implementing effective retention strategies.
- **Objectives:**
  1. Identify the key factors that contribute to customer churn.
  2. Develop a predictive model to forecast customer churn.
  3. Propose actionable strategies to improve customer retention based on insights from the model.

## Stakeholders

- **Internal:**
  - Marketing Team
  - Customer Service Team
  - Product Development Team
  - Senior Management
- **External:**
  - Customers
  - Investors

## Key Metrics and Success Criteria

- **Key Metrics:**
  - Churn Rate
  - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
  - Retention Rate
  - Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Reduction in churn rate by a defined percentage.
  - Improvement in customer satisfaction scores.
  - Increase in the average customer lifetime value.

## Hypothesis

- **Null Hypothesis (H1):**
  - "There is no difference in monthly charges `median` between customers who churn and those who do not churn."
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1'):**
  - "There is a difference in monthly charges `median` between customers who churn and those who do not churn."
- **Null Hypothesis (H2):**
  - "Customer churn depends on the period of time a customer has been with the company."
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H2'):**
  - "Customer churn does not depend on the period of time the customer has been with the company."

## Analytical Questions

1. What is the churn rate among customers?
2. Does the type of internet service influence customer churn?
3. Does the method of billing affect the likelihood of churn?
4. How do support services (tech support and online security) influence customer satisfaction and retention?
5. Does churn vary significantly across gender and age groups?

## Scope and Constraints

- **Scope:**
  - Analysis of customer data from the past two years.
  - Development and validation of a churn prediction model.
  - Recommendation of retention strategies based on model insights.
- **Constraints:**
  - Availability and quality of data.
  - Time and resource limitations.
  - Potential biases in the data that may affect model accuracy.
